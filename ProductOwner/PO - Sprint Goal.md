[Sprint Goal](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-trenches-sprint-goal)
===

Talk to the Product Owner : what is it that we want to achieve at the end of this Sprint?

- Make it visible.
- Teach the team to talk about progress towards the Sprint Goal in the **Daily Scrum**. It should be the only topic of conversation.
- Make the Sprint Goal a team measure and keep it visible in the team space
- Make it business or user focused when possible
- Make it focused on testing business assumptions and getting feedback

A Sprint Goal makes more sense than a bunch of Product Backlog Items packed together.

Invest time in Product Backlog refinement.

At end of a Sprint, is the entire team in agreement on whether or not the Sprint Goal has been achieved? If not, the Sprint Goal may be too vague.
- Ask "how will we know if we have achieved the Sprint Goal?"
- Make the Sprint Goal measurable
