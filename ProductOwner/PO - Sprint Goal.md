[Sprint Goal](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-trenches-sprint-goal)
===

Talk to the Product Owner : what is it that we want to achieve at the end of this Sprint?

- Make it visible.
- Teach the team to talk about progress towards the _Sprint Goal_ in the **Daily Scrum**. It should be the **only topic** of conversation.
- Make the _Sprint Goal_ a team measure and keep it visible in the team space.
- Make it **business** or **user** focused when possible.
- Make it focused on testing business assumptions and getting **feedback**.

A _Sprint Goal_ makes more sense than a bunch of _Product Backlog Items_ packed together.

Invest time in Product Backlog refinement.

[**Backlog refinement**](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/myth-14-refinement-required-meeting-entire-scrum-team)

Myth: Refinement is a required meeting for the entire Scrum Team.
The Scrum Guide is quite clear; refinement is not an event in Scrum.
It is something that Development Teams do as a natural part of development. It is not something that necessarily happens at a _fixed moment_ during the Sprint where _the entire Scrum Team_ has to attend.

- **Clarifying** items on the _Product Backlog_ that are too unclear to start work on.
- **Breaking down** items that are too big to pull into a Sprint.
- **Re-ordering** the _Product Backlog_ to make the upcoming Sprints as valuable as possible.
- **Adding** or **removing** items from the _Product Backlog_ as new insights emerge.
- **Estimating** the effort involved in implementing particular items.

[Why Estimate At All?](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/myth-9-story-points-are-required-scrum)
---

Estimation is not so much about the estimates, but about the **discussions** that it triggers. It’s about having a **conversation** — ideally with the actual customer — and creating a shared understanding.

When those estimates are exposed beyond the team's circle of trust we may indeed run the [risk of abuse](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/faking-it-estimates-and-metrics-scrum), of story points being commoditized, of teams being compared or obliged to bid for work using points as a cryptocurrency, and other abominations. In Scrum this is a risk which lies squarely with a _Product Owner_ to manage. As a member of the Scrum Team, the Product Owner is trusted to understand and respect the Development Team's estimates and to use any associated projections sensibly. The Product Owner will understand the limitations of using estimates to measure progress, and the importance of recalibrating a Product Burndown and any forecasts in light of the empirical evidence brought about by release. If there is doubt about the ability of other stakeholders to consume this data, then the Product Owner - as their representative, advocate and arbiter - must decide whether or not they ought to be exposed to estimated measures and forecasts at all. Perhaps they aren't. 


[A Good Sprint Goal](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/getting-done-creating-good-sprint-goals)
---

At end of a _Sprint_, is the entire team in agreement on whether or not the _Sprint Goal_ has been achieved? If not, the _Sprint Goal_ may be too vague.
- Ask "how will we know if we have achieved the _Sprint Goal_?"
- Make the _Sprint Goal_ measurable

[Bad examples](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/getting-done-creating-good-sprint-goals)

- "Get Jira tickets 17322, 17323, 171400 and 17888 to done"
- "Finish the authorization issues, create a procedure for capturing search queries and make it generic, create a new theme for mobile version"
- "Change the page to support HTML5 elements"
- "Enhance shopping cart functionality. Streamline purchasing process to enable an increase in conversion rates"
- "Improve performance. Increase page load time by X%"
- "On-board new market segment. Enable new market segment to purchase Service Y"

[Good examples](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/six-reasons-why-you-need-pay-more-attention-sprint-goal)

- "Implement the functionality for user registration"
- "Launch a partnership program (traders) for acquiring new clients and increasing the company's earnings"
- "Test technology X and technology Y, make a final decision based on the results"
- "Partners need to get remuneration according to the selected earnings model"
