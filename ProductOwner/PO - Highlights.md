The 2020 Scrum Guide - HIGHLIGHTS by Pumbaa
===

In order to obtain a _PSPO I Scrum Certification_ I compiled some highlights from [The 2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).
You can find all my personal documentation and files on my dedicated [github repository](https://github.com/pumbaa666/lab4tech/tree/main/ProductOwner).

Scrum Definition
---

Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.
Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.
Scrum employs an incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.
It consist of **Three Pillars** (Transparency > Inspection > Adaptation) and **Five Values** (Courage, Focus, Commitment, Respect, Openness).
It should be used for complex projects. If you are able to predict your work more than 3 sprints ahead you should not be doing Scrum as your product is not complex enough.

Scrum is a lightweight framework

 - The P.O. orders the work for a problem into a Backlog.
 - The Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
 - The Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.

Sprint
---

Short : a month or shorter

The **Product Owner** ensures that **attendees** are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal.
He is [one persone](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/why-you-need-only-one-product-owner), not a committee.
He can be helped by other persons, but he needs to make the decisions.
One Product Backlog means we need one Product Owner. It creates the transparency required for proper empiricism.
Having many POs encourages micromanagement of teams, requires coordination and bring unclear responsibility.


*How will the chosen work get done?*
For each Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work. This is done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the **sole discretion of the Developers**.

The **Product Goal** describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define "what" will fulfill the Product Goal.
The **Product Backlog** is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.
**Sprint Planning** initiates the Sprint. 8h or shorter.
The **Sprint Backlog** includes The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them.
It is [flexible](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/myth-2-sprint-backlog-cant-change-during-sprint), as long as changes do not distract from the focus on the *Sprint Goal*. Could be done during the Daily Scrum.
The **Sprint Review** inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. It's a _working session_, not a _presentation_ ! 4h or shorter.
The **Sprint Retrospective** plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness, identifies what went well during the Sprint and what problems it encountered. You can add things to next Sprint Backlog. 3h or shorter.

Work cannot be considered part of an **Increment** unless it meets the **Definition of Done**.

The Scrum Team
---
The Scrum Team consists of **one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers**. They are cross-functional and self-managing.
It's small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people.
If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.

Daily Scrum
---
Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.
