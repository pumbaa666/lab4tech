Scrum Definition
---

Scrum is a lightweight framework
	- The P.O. orders the work for a problem into a Backlog.
	- The Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
	- The Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.

Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.
Scrum employs an incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.
The Sprint combines three formal events : Transparency > Inspection > Adaptation 

The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. They are cross-functional and self-managing.
It's small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people.
If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.
