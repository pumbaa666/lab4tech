Scrum Definition
---

Scrum is a lightweight framework
	- The P.O. orders the work for a problem into a Backlog.
	- The Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
	- The Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.

Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.
Scrum employs an incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.
The Sprint combines three formal events : Transparency > Inspection > Adaptation
