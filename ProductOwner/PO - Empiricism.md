Empiricism, the act of making decisions based on what is, not fictitious plans.

We do the best we can with what we have.

[Three Pillars](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/three-pillars-empiricism-scrum)
---
Transparency > Inspection > Adaptation 

- Transparency : We all know what is going on
- Inspection : Check you work as you do it
- Adaptation : Ok to change direction

[Adaptation : What to change ?](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/agile-constant-change)
---

- Too much : If it is a significant or challenging thing, then only take one action. Talk about this item in each Daily Scrum.
- Nothing : The current state can be compared with the goal, and then find the one change that will give the most benefit for the least effort. **Once you are moving the momentum can grow**.
- Team VS Orga : The organisation needs to move to the mindset that things will be different, every day, every week. That is at the heart of business agility.

[Five Values](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/5-scrum-values-take-center-stage)
---
**F.O.R.C.C** : Focus, Openness, Respect, Courage, Commitment.

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values. People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems. Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.

Examples of bad application of these Five Values
- Committing to something that you don’t understand because you are told to by your boss instead of committing yourself to the team and Sprint Goal.
- Focusing on keeping the customer happy instead of being focused on the Sprint and its goal.
- Telling everyone everything about all your work instead of highlighting when you have challenges and problems that are stopping you from success.
- Thinking you are helping the team by being a hero instead of helping people to learn the things that you are good at and not judging the things that others aren’t good at.
- Continuing to push back instead of being transparent, or that your opinion is not the direction that the team is going.
